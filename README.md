# Truck_tracker
# This application built using reactjs
1)phone number authentication login by verifying OTP,I Have used Firebase phone number validation service for login.
2)Truck driver can add customer name ,phone number,location mark(latitude,longitude) which will be stored in Firestore
3)customer details is retrived from firestore,and displayed.
4)embded google map link is added.

Actually using google map api ,i need to mark driver current location and customers location in map and there should be start button which will be starting the tracking of driver to customers location by showing direction,it mark the path from driver to customer location .Stop button when driver wants to terminate tracking direction in middle.

since while creating google map api key,it asked Billing details,since i am a student,i couldn't afford it and i searched for other api for free but everyone asks billing details.

# In future,i will complete.
